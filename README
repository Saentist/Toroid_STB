Toroid - Open Source Middleware 

STATUS

This is a a new project, and as such, there is not much
documentation, and what you do find probably lags behind current
code.  Don't expect much yet, but please view, and critique
(in particular, your thoughts on the database structure
and web interface).

There are some install tips in the INSTALL file.  It is currently
known to be out of date (a more up to date version was on the wiki,
which is now down).

Please join the mailing lists, or catch us on irc.


DESIGN

It is generally agreed that this project needs ground up design and
planning.  Probably shoot for a proper implementation of the OpenIPTV
specs.

It is also apparent that such an approach will likely take years, and
there is some virtue in the ad-hoc "throw something together as a start"
approach.  It'll likely get something pieced together and a lot of lessons
learned.

So the current plan is to do both.  Anyone that wants to tinker can jump
right in now.  Those wanting to help design and plan a proper system are
quite welcome as well, and are encouraged to collaborate on the mailing lists
or setup some tools to facilitate it (SourceForge has a number of hosted apps
we can add easily).
